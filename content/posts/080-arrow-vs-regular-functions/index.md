In JavaScript, you can define functions in many ways.  

The first, usual way, is by using the `function` keyword:

```javascript
// Function declaration
function greet(who) {
  return `Hello, ${who}!`;
}
```

```javascript
// Function expression
const greet = function(who) {
  return `Hello, ${who}`;
}
```

The function declaration and function expression I'm going to reference as *regular function*.

The second way, available starting ES2015, is the *arrow function* syntax:

```javascript
const greet = (who) => {
  return `Hello, ${who}!`;
}
```

While both the regular and arrow syntaxes define functions, when would you choose one instead of another? That's a good question.  

In this post, I'm going to show the main differences between the two, so you could choose the right syntax for your needs.  

## 1. *this* value

### 1.1 Regular function

Inside of a regular JavaScript function, `this` value (aka the execution context) is dynamic.  

The dynamic context means that the value of `this` depends on *how* the function is invoked. In JavaScript, there are 4 ways you can invoke a regular function.  

During a *simple invocation* the value of `this` equals to the global object (or `undefined` if the function runs in strict mode):

```javascript
function myFunction() {
  console.log(this);
}

// Simple invocation
myFunction(); // logs global object (window)
```

During a *method invocation* the value of `this` is the object owning the method:

```javascript
const myObject = {
  method() {
    console.log(this);
  }
};
// Method invocation
myObject.method(); // logs "myObject"
```

During an *indirect invocation* using `myFunc.call(context, arg1, ..., argN)` or `myFunc.apply(context, [arg1, ..., argN])` the value of `this` equals to the first argument:

```javascript
function myFunction() {
  console.log(this);
}

const myContext = { value: 'A' };

myFunction.call(myContext);  // logs { value: 'A' }
myFunction.apply(myContext); // logs { value: 'A' }
```

During a *constructor invocation* using `new` keyword `this` equals to the newly created instance:

```javascript
function MyFunction() {
  console.log(this);
}

new MyFunction(); // logs an instance of MyFunction
```

### 1.2 Arrow function

The behavior of `this` inside of an arrow function differs considerably from the regular function's `this` behavior.  

No matter how or where being executed, `this` value inside of an array function always equals `this` value from the outer function. In other words, the arrow function resolves `this` lexically. In another words, the arrow function doesn't define its own execution context.  

In the following example, `myMethod()` is an outer function of `callback()` arrow function:

```javascript{3,5}
const myObject = {
  myMethod(items) {
    console.log(this); // logs "myObject"
    const callback = () => {
      console.log(this); // logs "myObject"
    };
    items.forEach(callback);
  }
};

myObject.myMethod([1, 2, 3]); 
```

`this` value inside the arrow function `callback()` equals to `this` of the outer function `myMethod()`.  

`this` resolved lexically is one of the great features of arrow functions. When using callbacks inside methods you are sure the arrow function doesn't define its own `this`: no more `const self = this` or `callback.bind(this)` workarounds.  

## 2. Constructors

## 2.1 Regular function

As seen in the previous section, the regular function can easily construct objects.  

For example, the `Car()` function creates instances of a car:

```javascript
function Car(color) {
  this.color = color;
}

const redCar = new Car('red');
redCar instanceof Car; // => true
```

`Car` is a regular function, and when invoked with `new` keyword, it creates new instances of `Car` type.  

## 2.2 Arrow function

A consequence of `this` resolved lexically is that an arrow function cannot be used as a constructor.  

If you try to invoke an arrow function prefixed with `new` keyword, JavaScrip throws an error:

```javascript
const Car = (color) => {
  this.color = color;
};

const redCar = new Car('red'); // TypeError: Car is not a constructor 
```

Invoking `new Car('red')`, where `Car` is an arrow function, throws `TypeError: Car is not a constructor`. 

## 3. *arguments* object

### 3.1 Regular function

Inside the body of a regular function, `arguments` is a special array-like object containing the list of arguments with which the function has been invoked.  

Let's invoke `myFunction` function with 3 arguments:

```javascript{2}
function myFunction() {
  console.log(arguments);
}

myFunction('a', 'b'); // logs { 0: 'a', 1: 'b'}
```

`arguments` array-like object contains the invocation arguments: `'a'` and `'b'`.  

### 3.2 Arrow function

On the other side, no `arguments` special keyword is defined inside an arrow function. 

Again (same as with `this` value), the `arguments` object is resolved lexically: the arrow function accesses `arguments` from the outer function.  

Let's try to access `arguments` inside of an arrow function:

```javascript{2-4}
function myRegularFunction() {
  const myArrowFunction = () => {
    console.log(arguments);
  }

  myArrowFunction('c', 'd');
}

myRegularFunction('a', 'b'); // logs { 0: 'a', 1: 'b' }
```

The arrow function `myArrowFunction()` is invoked with the arguments `'c'`, `'d'`. Still, inside of its body, `arguments` object equals to the arguments of `myRegularFunction()` invocation: `'a'`, `'b'`.  

If you'd like to access the direct arguments of the arrow function, then you can use [the rest parameters](/javascript-function-parameters/#5-rest-parameters) feature:

```javascript{2-4}
function myRegularFunction() {
  const myArrowFunction = (...args) => {
    console.log(args);
  }

  myArrowFunction('c', 'd');
}

myRegularFunction('a', 'b'); // logs { 0: 'c', 1: 'd' }
```

`...args` rest parameter collects the execution arguments of the arrow function: `{ 0: 'c', 1: 'd' }`.  

## 4. Implicit *return*

### 4.1 Regular function

Just use `return expression` statement to return a result from a function:

```javascript
function myFunction() {
  return 42;
}

myFunction(); // => 42
```

If the `return` statement is missing, or there's no expression after return statement, the regular function implicitely returns `undefined`:

```javascript
function myEmptyFunction() {
  42;
}

function myEmptyFunction2() {
  42;
  return;
}

myEmptyFunction();  // => undefined
myEmptyFunction2(); // => undefined
```

### 4.2 Arrow function

You can return values from the arrow function the same way as from a regular function, but with one useful exception.  

If the arrow function contains one expression, and you omit the function's curly braces, then the expression is explicitly returned. These are [the inline arrows function](/javascript-arrow-functions-best-practices/#2-inline-when-possible).  

```javascript
const increment = (num) => num + 1;

increment(41); // => 42
```

The `increment()` arrow consists of only one expression: `num + 1`. This expression is implicitly returned by the arrow function without the use of `return` keyword.  

## 5. Methods

### 5.1 Regular function

The regular functions are the usual way to define methods on classes.  

In the following class `Hero`, the method `logName()` is defined using a regular function:

```javascript{6-8}
class Hero {
  constructor(heroName) {
    this.heroName = heroName;
  }

  logName() {
    console.log(this.heroName);
  }
}

const batman = new Hero('Batman');
```

Usually, the regular functions as methods are the way to go.  

Sometimes you'd need to supply the method as a callback, for example to `setTimeout()` or an event listener. In such cases, you might encounter difficulties to access `this` value.  

For example, let's use `logName()` method as a callback to `setTimeout()`:

```javascript
setTimeout(batman.logName, 1000);
// after 1 second logs "undefined"
```

After 1 second, `undefined` is logged to console. `setTimeout()` performs a simple invocation of `logName` (where `this` is the global object). That's when [the method is separated from the object](/gentle-explanation-of-this-in-javascript/#32-pitfall-separating-method-from-its-object).  

Let's bind `this` value manually to the right context:

```javascript
setTimeout(batman.logName.bind(batman), 1000);
// after 1 second logs "Batman"
```

`batman.logName.bind(batman)` binds `this` value to `batman` instance. Now you're sure that the method doesn't lose the context.   

Binding `this` manually requires boilerplate code, especially if you have lots of methods. There's a better way: the arrow functions as a class field.  

### 5.2 Arrow function

Thanks to [Class fields proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields) (at this moment at stage 3) you can use the arrow function as methods inside classes.  

Now, in contrast with regular functions, the method defined using an arrow binds `this` lexically to the class instance.  

Let's use the arrow function as a field:

```javascript{6-8}
class Hero {
  constructor(heroName) {
    this.heroName = heroName;
  }

  logName = () => {
    console.log(this.heroName);
  }
}

const batman = new Hero('Batman');
```

Now you can use `batman.logName` as a callback without any manual binding of `this`. The value of `this` inside `logName()` method is always the class instance:

```javascript
setTimeout(batman.logName, 1000);
// after 1 second logs "Batman"
```

## 6. Summary

Understanding the differences between regular and arrow functions helps choose the right syntax for specific needs.  

`this` value inside a regular function is dynamic and depends on the invocation. But `this` inside the arrow function is bound lexically and equals to `this` of the outer function.  

`arguments` object inside the regular functions contains the list of arguments. The arrow function, on the opposite, doesn't define `arguments` (but you can easily access the arrow function arguments using a rest parameter `...args`).  

If the arrow function has one expression, then the expression is returned implicitly, even without using the `return` keyword.  

Last but not least, you can define methods using the arrow function syntax inside classes. Fat arrow methods bind `this` value to the class instance.  

Anyhow the fat arrow method is invoked, `this` always equals to the class instance, which is useful when the methods are used as callbacks.
